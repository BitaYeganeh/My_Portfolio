    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
          I'm a passionate web development student at <span class="bold-text">Business College Helsinki</span>, where I’m diving deep into the fundamentals of modern front-end development.</p>
        
        <p>
          My current focus is on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Collaboration is at the heart of how I grow. I enjoy working in teams, bouncing around ideas, and learning from feedback and <strong>learning by donig.</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Beyond the technical side, I’m passionate about <strong>problem-solving</strong> and learning through hands-on projects. I believe the best way to grow is by building real things. Every new project is an opportunity to explore, make mistakes, and improve.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I enjoy working in teams, sharing ideas, and gaining feedback from peers and mentors. I value clear communication, curiosity, and staying open to new tools and ways of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I’m looking forward to diving into <strong>React</strong>, strengthening my skills with Git, and becoming more confident with version control and modern development workflows. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded <u>front-end developer</u> who builds websites that are not only technically sound but also meaningful and inclusive.
